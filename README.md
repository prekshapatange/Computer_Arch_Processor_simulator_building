# 🖥️ Computer Architecture Lab Assignments

This repository contains my **Computer Architecture Laboratory assignments**, organized into multiple subfolders.  
Each folder represents a different lab/task and includes code, documentation, and resources related to processor design and simulation.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prekshapatange/CA-LAB-Assignments.git
   cd CA-LAB-Assignments
Navigate into the desired assignment folder
Each assignment folder contains code, input/output files, and sometimes a report (.tex or .pdf).

Run or Compile the programs

Assembly programs can be executed on simulators like MARS, SPIM, or custom simulators (as required).

LaTeX/Beamer files can be compiled with pdflatex
Topics Covered

Assembly language basics

Arithmetic and logical instructions

Control flow (loops, branching, conditions)

Memory addressing and stack operations

Processor Simulation: Building a simplified CPU model

Writing lab reports using LaTeX

Preparing presentations with Beamer

🛠️ Tools & Requirements

MARS/SPIM – for running MIPS assembly code

C / C++ / Java (where applicable, for processor simulation tasks)

LaTeX – for documentation and reports

Beamer – for presentations

✨ Learning Outcomes

By completing these assignments, I gained hands-on experience in:

Low-level programming with assembly

Understanding the working of CPU instructions

Designing and simulating processor operations

Documenting technical work professionally using LaTeX

Presenting lab work effectively with Beamer
